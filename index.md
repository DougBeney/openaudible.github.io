## Quick Start
Install the version for your platform. Until we get a signing certificate, you will be warned that this is an unsigned application.

Note: Mac users should open the OpenAudible.pkg installer by selecting it in Finder and Control-Clicking the application, then select Open. This is due to our not being available in the Apple Store or and not having a signing certificate. 

First time you use the application, open the Browser window (Ctrl-B from the Controls menu) and log into your Audible.com account and browse to your list of purchased books.

Then enter your credentials into the preferences. You can leave the password blank if you want.

You may want to set the working directory or output directory to a disk that more space or that is located on a network storage device.

Then Connect to audible... Your library details should be imported. No files will be downloaded.

You can browse the books you have purchased from audible.

From there, you can choose to download one or more books.

Converting AAX files to MP3 is done by selecting one or more downloaded files and choosing "Convert to MP3" from the Action menu. Or simply select "Convert All to MP3" from the Controls menu.

You can also import all existing AAX files you may have already downloaded by using the File: Import AAX Files or simply dragging them into application.

More help is available under the Help Menu.

Uninstalling OpenAudible can be done with the uninstaller. Your settings are saved in the "Working directory" defined in the preferences. On Windows, it is C:\Users\NAME\OpenAudible. On Mac it is /Users/NAME/Library/OpenAudible.
